DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHM 

The folder named "Screenshot" contains eleven screenshots of the graphs or the output.

The folder named "Folder" contains three files. The files are "fileOs.py", "numbers.txt", and "result.txt".
  - "fileOs.py" contains the code 
  - "numbers.txt" contains the one to fifty numbers.
  - "result.txt" contains the result or output.

This code is a Python script that allows users to choose from a list of mathematical equations and plot the results with Matplotlib. A basic overview of how the code works is provided below:
  - This code begins by retrieving the contents of another text file called "number.txt". That contains the numbers 1 to 50. After receiving the file, "fileOs.py" uses the numbers.
  - The next step is to plot the mathematical equation, which will be used as a graph later on.
  - The next step is deciding which one to graph for each equation. It is up to the user whether they want to choose between the numbers 1 through 11. Each number represents the mathematical equation that will be graphed. And the last number, 11, contains all of the mathematical equations in a single graph.
  - Finally, the graphing result will be appended to "result.txt", displaying the graph's solution.
